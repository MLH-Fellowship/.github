# Learn software engineering through open source projects.
A fully remote, 12-week internship alternative where participants earn a stipend and learn to collaborate on real open source projects with peers and engineers from top companies.

## Learning to code is like getting from zero to one. MLH helps developers get from one to a job.
The things you learn in a classroom aren't the things you need to know to launch a career in tech. During the MLH Fellowship, you'll gain the type of applied experience that employers want to see.
